LogicLens: Where Logic Meets Lens
LogicLens is a digital sanctuary for my journey as a developer and my perspective as a photographer. This portfolio serves as a centralized hub for my academic projects and personal experiments, built on a foundation of clean, modular code.

About the Project
LogicLens is crafted with a component-based architecture using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. My design philosophy centers on minimalism and accessibility, ensuring that the code is as readable as the visual interface.

Tech Stack: Vanilla Web Technologies (No frameworks, just pure logic).

Design: Custom CSS variables for maintainability and a fluid, responsive layout.

Key Features
Thematic Toggle: Seamless switching between Dark and Light modes using CSS variables.

Responsive Architecture: A mobile-first design that adapts gracefully to any viewport.

Curated Projects:

Java Calculator: Precision-focused computational tool.

Python To-Do List: Efficient task management logic.

Editorial Blog Template: Typography-led design for long-form content.
