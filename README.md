# LogicLens: Where Logic Meets Lens

**LogicLens** is a digital sanctuary for my journey as a developer and my perspective as a photographer. This portfolio serves as a centralized hub for my academic projects and personal experiments, built on a foundation of clean, modular code.

## About the Project
LogicLens is crafted with a **component-based architecture** using **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**. My design philosophy centers on minimalism and accessibility, ensuring that the code is as readable as the visual interface.

* **Tech Stack:** Vanilla Web Technologies.
* **Design:** Custom CSS variables for maintainability and a fluid, responsive layout.

## Key Features
* **Theme Switching:** Seamless transition between Dark and Light modes using CSS variables.
* **Responsive Architecture:** Mobile-first design that adapts gracefully to any viewport.
* **Project Showcasing:**
    * **Java Calculator:** Precision-focused computational logic.
    * **Python To-Do List:** Efficient task management.
    * **Editorial Blog Template:** Typography-led design for long-form content.
